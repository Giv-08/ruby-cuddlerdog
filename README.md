### How to clone this project
```
git clone https://github.com/Giv-08/ruby-cuddlerdog.git
```
### Run the Application
The way to run the application depends on the structure of the app. Here are common ways:
1. Rails Application: If it's a Rails app, use the following command to start the server:
```
rails server
```
You can then access the app in your browser at http://localhost:3000.

2. Sinatra or Other Ruby Apps: Check the README.md file in the repository for specific instructions on how to run the app. For a Sinatra app, you might need to run:
```
ruby app.rb
```
3. If the app uses a different framework or has custom scripts, the repository might contain a startup file (e.g., start.rb, run.rb), so try:
```
ruby <filename>.rb
```
### Access the Application
Open your browser and navigate to the port the application is running on. If you're using Rails, for example, it will be # http://localhost:3000.
